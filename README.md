# AKVM Portfolio
Contains all of the GitHub Pages for our Template Websites

About our GitHub Pages & Templates
--------------------

We strive to provide our clients with the best resources to make an educated decision on their Website Hosting service and Design Platforms. Previously, we partnered with SquareSpace / Weebly to provide clients with a custom 'deisgn it yourself' platform that was easy to use, update, and change as the client needed. Now, we are much more focused on the content, speed, and custom design of our sites. With GitHub Pages, we have the tools and resources to create stunning websites, at a fraction of the price, while still providing clients with the integrations, applicaitons, software, and speed they need.

When you purchase a site from AKVM, you will have access to our codebase. This allows for you to view and request custom integrations and take a peek at the 'behind the scenes' work we put in to make your site special. This documentation will help teach you more about our templates and how they are structured.
